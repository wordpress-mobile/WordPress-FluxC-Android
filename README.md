# WordPress-FluxC-Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android)

WordPress-FluxC-Android is a networking and persistence library that helps to connect and sync data from a WordPress site (self hosted, or wordpress.com site).

Based on the [Flux][1] pattern, we're using: [Dagger2][2] for dependency injection, [WellSql][3] for persistence.

FluxC is pronounced ‘fluxy’, and stands for ‘Flux Capacitor’. This makes a double reference to the architecture model (since a capacitor is a kind of storage unit, or ‘store’). More importantly, a flux capacitor is the core component of the DeLorean time machine in [Back to the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future), which ‘makes time travel possible.’

**Most of our documentation for using and contributing to FluxC can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android/wiki).**

## Using FluxC as a library

Please see our [Using FluxC](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android/wiki/Using-FluxC#initial-setup) wiki page for setup instructions.

## Building the library

The gradle build system will fetch all dependencies and generate
files you need to build the project. You first need to generate the
local.properties (replace YOUR_SDK_DIR with your actual android SDK directory)
file and create the gradle.properties file. The easiest way is to copy
our example:

    $ echo "sdk.dir=YOUR_SDK_DIR" > local.properties
    $ ./gradlew fluxc:build

## Building and running tests and the example app

    $ cp example/gradle.properties-example example/gradle.properties
    $ cp example/tests.properties-example example/tests.properties
    $ ./gradlew cAT       # Regression tests
    $ ./gradlew testDebug # Unit tests

Note: this is the default `example/gradle.properties` file. You'll have to get
a WordPress.com OAuth2 ID and secret.

We have some tests connecting to real HTTP servers, URL and credentials are defined in `example/tests.properties`, you must edit it or obtain the real file to run the tests. This is temporary.

## Setting up Checkstyle

The FluxC project uses [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/). You can run checkstyle using `./gradlew checkstyle`.  You can also view errors and warnings in realtime with the Checkstyle plugin.  When importing the project into Android Studio, Checkstyle should be set up automatically.  If it is not, follow the steps below.

You can install the CheckStyle-IDEA plugin in Android Studio here:

`Android Studio > Preferences... > Plugins > CheckStyle-IDEA`

Once installed, you can configure the plugin here:

`Android Studio > Preferences... > Other Settings > Checkstyle`

From there, add and enable the configuration file for FluxC, located at [config/checkstyle.xml](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-FluxC-Android/blob/develop/config/checkstyle.xml).

### Compatibility

Checkstyle 8.1 breaks backward compatibility with previous versions including the current configuration file.  Be sure to target Checkstyle 8.0 or lower when configuring the CheckStyle-IDEA plugin in Android Studio. If you see the following error(s), check your plugin target.

## Contributing

### Actions

Each store should have a corresponding enum defining actions for that store. For example, [SiteStore][4]'s actions are defined in the [SiteAction][5] enum.

Action naming guide:

    FETCH_X - request data from the server
    PUSH_X - send data to the server
    UPDATE_X - local change
    REMOVE_X - local remove
    DELETE_X - request deletion on the server

Each action enum should be annotated with `@ActionEnum`, with individual actions receiving an `@Action` annotation with an optional `payloadType` setting (see [SiteAction][5] for an example).

### Endpoints

Endpoints for each of the supported APIs are centralized in a generated endpoint file: `WPCOMREST.java` and `XMLRPC.java` (also `WPAPI.java`).

To add a new endpoint, first add it to the appropriate `fluxc/src/main/tools/*.txt` file, and then rebuild the project to update the generated (Java) endpoint file.

Note that, for WordPress.com REST API endpoints, the final endpoint will be normalized to include a trailing slash.

### On Changed Events

All On Changed Events extend the OnChanged class. They encapsulate an `error`
field. Events can be checked for an error by calling `event.isError()`.

On Changed Events naming guide:

    onXChanged(int rowsAffected) - Keep X singular even if multiple X were changed
    onXRemoved(int rowsAffected) - Keep X singular even if multiple X were removed
